While this allows Setro to not fall for his enemies' manipulation or dissuasion tactics, inspire his allies and allows him to win battles he'd otherwise lose, it also makes it difficult for his comrades to understand him and causes him to become impatient and lose sight of his surroundings.

Also unlike in later games using the Knight class, the Warrior once promoted can't really contribute to shielding others completely from harm, as he lacks the abilities [Cover](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyIII) and [Guard](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyV).",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EarlyInstallmentWeirdness

His first exclusive weapon is the legendary [Excalibur](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Excalibur), which is the best weapon in the base game thanks to it's ability which imbues it with all the elements and thus is super effective against every enemy in the game.

In the original 8-bit sprites, the Warrior continues to wear his crimson red armor modified to fit his more adult looking body.

The Warrior is the only class who can wield axes without completing the class change sidequest. He can also wield hammers, although other weapons eclipse their efficacy.

In the novelization Setro is the most heroic and faithful out of the four in following the Crystals' orders to save the world and help the general populace (exasperating Zauver).

Ninja is just a Red Wizard, only with marginally better stats and a *fraction* of the magic. [Square Enix](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Creator/SquareEnix) has redeemed them on the PSP. The Thief has better stats overall, especially Agility, and they can equip Bucklers this time, while the Ninja has improved defenses and attacking power compared to the original.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBuff
../data/FinalFantasy/FFI/,Final Fantasy,Thief,Thief,Blood Knight,0," [Blood Knight](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BloodKnight): In *Memory of Heroes*, Zauver tends to be the first to leap into battle, in spite of his [usual snark](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadpanSnarker).

Even at max level, the Thief will wind up with low average HP. Once promoted to a Ninja things turn around as he becomes a master in Evasion and Agility.

Ice Brand is a point in the game where the Ninja will be doing almost twice as much damage as the Master. Ninjas can also carry a variety of shields and his selection is second only to the Knight. He can also learn some very useful Black Magic, most notably Haste and Temper.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MagikarpPower
../data/FinalFantasy/FFI/,Final Fantasy,Thief,Thief,Master of None,0," [Master of None](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone): Thief is the worst character available before the class change, with worse defense than the Warrior, speed on par with the Monk, weaker attack power than both of them, and no magic to make up for it.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MasterOfNone
../data/FinalFantasy/FFI/,Final Fantasy,Thief,Thief,Multi-Melee Master,0," [Multi-Melee Master](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiMeleeMaster): If you're a fan of being able to equip everything in sight, Ninja is the only class besides Monk who can wield nunchaku, along with longswords, axes, hammers, and staves.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MultiMeleeMaster

-   In the NES version, the nunchaku are viable for a little while, but once the Monk reaches level 8, his fists will out-damage even the Iron Nunchaku. In the remakes, his fists out-power any other weapon options from the start.
-   Magic Defense is only a concern for Monk on the NES due to an odd bug which causes him to gain less after class changing. This is fixed in the remakes.
-   The PSP version also implemented Strength Tonics that are roughly on par with Temper. Your Master can now power himself up in a way similar to a Ninja.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BalanceBuff

The Monk gets no weapons after Corneria, and he doesn't need any. As if to highlight this, he can only use nunchaku and a staff or two.

At the start of the game, you equip him; later on, you unequip him. That's it. The rest of the time, he just punches enemies, except when using magic items that anyone can use. He can't beat the god of melee combat (Warrior), but not having to buy anything saves a lot of Gil, and cash doesn't flow too well early on.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BoringButPractical
../data/FinalFantasy/FFI/,Final Fantasy,Monk (Black Belt),Monk (Black Belt),Crippling Overspecialization,0," [Crippling Overspecialization](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CripplingOverspecialization): The Monk's Defense only equals his level when he has *no* armor equipped at all.

../data/FinalFantasy/FFI/,Final Fantasy,Monk (Black Belt),Monk (Black Belt),Critical Hit Class,0," [Critical Hit Class](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CriticalHitClass): The Monk gets double the hits when barehanded because that represents both hands attacking, whereas all other weapons are one-handed, and you don't attack with the off hand.

It has subpar defense, and won't match the Warrior's damage until later. While unarmed, the Monk gets twice the hits (one for each hand). So even though each attack hurts less, the total damage is higher. After every few levels, he gains another two hits. By that point, any weapon he's still holding is holding him back. Pretty soon, he's getting over a dozen hits on his turn, with his Attack power rivaling some of the best weapons.

They might get away with building up one physically and the other magically; otherwise, things get really expensive, *really* fast. 20,000 gil per spell in Crescent Town, 3 spells each. Total: 60,000 gil per Red Mage. Now throw in the equipment.

Later versions give them access to the considerably more powerful Healing Staff, Sage's Staff, and Judgment Staff (but only as an item). They can switch between attack magic with the Judgment Staff, healing magic with the Healing/Sage's Staff, or dealing physical damage.

Their lack of HP isn't really felt yet, since armor is more important. They can function as a secondary tank (thanks to Chain Mail) or healer, and they aren't completely worthless without MP. But they struggle to find good armor late in the game, and they eat up Gil when buying magic.
