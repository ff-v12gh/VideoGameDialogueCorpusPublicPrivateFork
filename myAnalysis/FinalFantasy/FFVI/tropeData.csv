QUOTE **Kefka:** Why do people insist on creating things that will inevitably be destroyed? Why do people cling to life, knowing that they must someday die? ...Knowing that none of it will have meant anything once they do?  
**Terra:** Because it's not the end that matters! It's knowing that you have something to live for right now, at this moment! Something you've worked for... something that's worth protecting! As long as you have that...that's enough!

Kefka, being a [Straw Nihilist](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawNihilist) subject to [Sanity Slippage](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SanitySlippage), shows the dark side of this trope when his rampant thirst for destruction eventually leads him to the conclusion that everything exists only to be destroyed, preferably by him.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CharacterDevelopment

../data/FinalFantasy/FFVI/,Final Fantasy VI,Terra,Terra Branford,Depending on the Artist,0," [Depending on the Artist](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist): One of the most infamous cases in the series. Not only is Terra's hair a different color from concept art to in-game appearance, but her outfit is also substantially different.<ul>
-   Originally the design team decided to give Terra green hair because Celes was already blond. They also designed the character sprites *first* before handing off their work to Yoshitaka Amano which was the opposite order of the previous games. Tetsuya Nomura later stated in an interview that had Amano started with the character art, he would have always given Terra blond hair.
-   The green hair was her signature look up until *Dissidia*, which gave her blonde hair since everyone in that game was based mostly on their original concept art. Since then the blonde hair became the usual look for her, but the green hair continues to pop up, particularly in sprite-based cameos (but not just them).
-   Her sprite and SD artwork depict her with a red minidress, no tights, and a large pair of purple shoulder pads, while her concept art shows her in a red minidress with tights, no shoulder pads, and a pink cape. The original *Dissidia* based her design on her concept art and so went with the tights and cape, while her alt outfit removes the tights and gives her the green hair in reference to her game sprite. The arcade *Dissidia* gives her a more faithful variant of this outfit that removes the cape and adds the shoulder pads to complete the sprite-inspired look.
-   Later games after *Dissidia* tie her hair color and dress design together — the blonde hair goes with the tights and cape look, and the green hair goes with the no tights and shoulder pads look. Aside from the arcade *Dissidia*, *Record Keeper* includes both her designs, though with the green-haired one as the default and the blonde-haired one as the alt. Other games mostly stick to one design or the other now.
-   This also applies to Terra's eye color, which has variously been blue, [green](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CurtainsMatchTheWindow), or purple. These days she's *mostly* settled on a purple-ish blue.</ul>",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DependingOnTheArtist

The problem happens for the small handful of battles where he isn't facing to the left due to a back or pincer attack.

This is due to limitations of the game's color palettes though, since character sprites share palettes and there just isn't enough room on Leo's to allow him a unique skin tone.

Move them out of alignment and the imbalance of power drastically reshapes the known world, which is exactly what Kefka does once he sends Gestahl flying.

../data/FinalFantasy/FFVI/,Final Fantasy VI,The Eight Dragons,The Eight Dragons,Weaksauce Weakness,0," [Weaksauce Weakness](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness): Their original forms can be rendered almost helpless with basic status spells. The Ice Dragon is subseptible to Silence, as is the Holy Dragon (and it has absolutely no physical attack), Dirt Dragon can be put to Sleep, Red Dragon can be Confused and Rasped to die at 0 MP (and only has 1780 MP so that'll take only a few turns), Skull Dragon can also be Rasped to death and only has a few hundred more MP, and Gold Dragon can be Berserked so it can only use physical blows. The only ones that *can't* be locked down are the Blue Dragon and Storm Dragon. However, the Blue Dragon is fought so late into the game and has such low HP for that point that he's a pushover anyway. Appropriately, the Storm Dragon, fought early on if you follow the nudges the game gives you, is generally considered the strongest dragon.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WeaksauceWeakness

../data/FinalFantasy/FFVI/,Final Fantasy VI,Ultros,Ultros,Dub Name Change,0," [Dub Name Change](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DubNameChange): Originally called ""Orthros"" in Japanese, as he and Typhon are [both named after Greek monsters](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThemeNaming). Later *FF* games have waffled on which version of the name to use, but the general rule seems to be that a monster which **looks like** him is Orthros, while one that actually **is** the *FFVI* character (such as the *[Final Fantasy XIII-2](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyXIII2)* Coliseum DLC) is Ultros. In contrast, his buddy Typhon, who was named Chupon in the SNES version, was properly named Typhon in all installments ever since, with the exception of the original PS1 version of *[Final Fantasy VII](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FinalFantasyVII)*, where he was named Typoon. <sup>note </sup>  It got changed back to Typhon in the PC release, as well as all future releases of the game which use the PC version's script.

You'd expect some sort of aquatic boss to appear on the Lethe River, but then Ultros is suddenly able to go on land and is at the Opera House to sabotage the party's plans. Then even later he's at Crescent Island plotting to steal some statues to impress Siegfried, who Ultros has never even mentioned before. Then somehow he's flying in with the Imperial Air Force on Typhon, also never mentioned or seen before but suddenly he's Ultros' accomplice. Given how silly and pathetic Ultros is, this escalating absurdity may well be intentional.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GiantSpaceFleaFromNowhere

../data/FinalFantasy/FFVI/,Final Fantasy VI,Ultros,Ultros,Harmless Villain,0," [Harmless Villain](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain): His battles in *VI* were never all that difficult to begin with, and he was never as formidable as his more rarely-seen friend Typhon.

You can see him and speak to him as often as you please, but his role as a villain has ended.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HarmlessVillain
../data/FinalFantasy/FFVI/,Final Fantasy VI,Ultros,Ultros,Jerkass,0," [Jerkass](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass): Ultros is this in spades. While he is the game's [Plucky Comic Relief](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PluckyComicRelief), he's also downright mean. He attacks your party several times throughout the game for no reason other than just because. In the battle against him in Crescent Mountain, he mouths off to Relm, a little girl who just wanted to paint his picture. This causes the party to stop fighting and *berate Ultros* for making a little girl cry! He eventually caves in. Of course, Relm had [ulterior motives](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArtInitiatesLife) for painting his picture, but Ultros didn't know that and still reacted badly to it.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Jerkass

He's also something of a [Butt-Monkey](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ButtMonkey) that is doomed to fail his antagonism, keeping it from being any more than just commentary.",/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LovableSexManiac

../data/FinalFantasy/FFVI/,Final Fantasy VI,Ultros,Ultros,To Serve Man,0," [To Serve Man](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToServeMan): The SNES translation changes his lusting after Terra in the first fight against him to [a carnivorous desire to eat her, not unlike a sapient predator after prey](/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SapientEatSapient).

Ultros's first fight is generally not that difficult. Except for the fact that he at one point specifically targets Banon with a powerful attack because ""your ugly mug gives me the creeps.""
