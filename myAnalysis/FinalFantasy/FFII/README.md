# Final Fantasy II

## Source

FFII has an 'ask' system, where the player can interrogate certain keywords in NPCs dialogue. These must be initiated by the player, so are listed here as choices with an alternative choice of doing nothing.

## Gender Coding

Some of the characters with female gender generic descriptions (wandering wife etc.) had been incorrectly coded as male; I've moved them to female. 

"Leon leaves"... is an action description so I've left it uncoded. "remain clear and true" is part of the previous "SYSTEM" line, so I've also left it uncoded. 

"Child" seems to refer to a male character (or two male characters), based on the other dialogue ('son' etc.). 

"Cid's Buddy" is referred to by Cid as 'the guy behind me', so coded male. 

Guy says of the Giant Beaver, "I speak with him". So I've coded it as male. 

The "Imperial Soldier" is a black knight enemy type, who seem to be treated as male (male pronouns in the wiki, no female gender signifiers etc.) so I've coded accordingly. 

"Mage" is an enemy type (also known as "Magician" or "Warlock"). Although "Warlock" usually denotes a male, it's not super clear what its gender is, so I've coded as neutral. 

The various other mage NPCs in Mysidia don't have an obvious gender - they all have the same sprites (orange robes (or blue for shopkeepers) and pointed hats), and nothing in their dialogue gives anything away. I've coded as neutral. 

"Pirate" is a type of enemy and a NPC sprite in FFII. Both appear male. I think the soldier sprites are male (that would be in keeping with other games in the series). 

In Semitt Falls, there are particular sprites for Nelly and Paul, but the slaves seem to be all the same male sprite. Likewise for the townspeople in Bafsk. 

The Tropical Islanders wear masks; their gender is ambiguous. Coded neutral. 

For plot reasons, most villager NPCs in Salamand are female, so I've coded "Various Villagers" accordingly. 

"Wizard" is referred to as "that grandpa" at one point, and given that the same sprites are reused throughout, I'm coding "Wizard" as male. 

Source describes several apparently female characters as men (in Salamand); fixed with aliases.
